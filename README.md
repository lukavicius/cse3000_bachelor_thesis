# cse3000_bachelor_thesis
This code was submitted for BsC thesis for TU Delft

The Nile simulation was done by Yasin Sari, most improvements were done on data, model_nile, model_classes, and output analysis.
The original code can be found here: https://github.com/ysari97/master-thesis-project.

Data was mainly taken from two sources: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017WR022149 and https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02508060.2016.1177698.

The code for rl4water was written in a group of 5 people for the bachelor thesis. The other authors are Krzysztof Muniak, Jakub Kontak, Jorian Faber and Burak Tezcan.

For both of the projects there are package versions in the requirements.txt files, which have to be installed using pip or conda.

EMODPS optimiation can be run in bachelor_project\master-thesis-simulation\nile_EMODPS_framework\experimentation\baseline_optimization.py. The analyses can be done via multiple python files in nile_EMODPS_framework\output_analysis.

MONES optimization can be run in bachelor_project\rl4water\water_management.py. The short analysis is in the same document commented out.
